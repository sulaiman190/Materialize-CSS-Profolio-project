    <p>I am Sulaiman Jalloh. I am 27 years old and I live in the Bronx. I am originally from West Africa, Sierra Leone.
        I am currently pursuing a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science at Lehman college.
        I am also graduated with an Associate Degree in Computer Science at LaGuardia Community college.
        I have experience in java and c++ and little in networking system.
        I am currently looking for internship where I can learn more, improve myself and get more experience.
        I am self-motivated person who like to work hard and get the job done.
        However, I like to take my time to do the job right because I believe with patience, motivation everything is possible.
        I donâ€™t believe in quitting because I always push myself very hard.
        I believe trying is another way to describe my failure, I always make sure I accomplish what I started and get the job done.
        I am currently working an overnight shift as a building concierge to pay for my school and put food on the table for my family but I make sure I show up to class on time and do the work.
        I like to learn new things but I enjoy programing because I found myself very happy I finish working code and running perfectly.</p>
